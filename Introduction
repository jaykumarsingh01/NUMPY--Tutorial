Numpy:
Numpy is a low level library written  in C (and FORTRAN) for high level mathematical function. Numpy  cleaverly overcomes the problem of running slower algorithm on python by using 
multidimensional array and function that operate on array. Any algorithm can then be expressed as a function on array, allowing the algorithm to be run quickly.

Numpy what works:
1. a powerful N-dimensional array object
2. sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
3. tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
4. useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

NOTE:
In numpy there is only one data structure N-d array(n-dimesional array) and in python there is nine data structure

Application of numpy(n-d array properties)
1.Homogenous.
2.Only be number(Number,Float,Complex)
3.Fixed item size.
